A university group project where I contributed modelling analysis and visualsation.
We analysed a data set of physical features of abalone and created a model to predict their age. We used an algorithmic stepwise method to create a MLR model which was sufficiently accurate in it's predictition. 
Could be used to support conservation of abalone where their age could be determined without destroying the animal
Created some interesting predictive graphs looking at pairwise relationships.
